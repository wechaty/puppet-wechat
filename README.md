Wechaty Puppet for WeChat

- This repository is a sub module of Wechaty. See: <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-wechat/issues/1>
- Source code before moved to here can be found at Wechaty repository: [Wechaty/src/puppet-puppeteer#a2c56e6](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/tree/a2c56e62642f9004243e3ad8e9c9d0b0dd1a4761/src/puppet-puppeteer)

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. Solved by UOS. ~~WeChat Account that registered after 2017 mignt not be able to login Web Wechat, so it can not use PuppetWeChat with Wechaty. Please make sure your WeChat Account can be able to login by visiting <https://wx.qq.com>~~
1. Web API can not create room and invite members to room since 2018.
1. Can not Receive/Send message from Work Wechat.

If you want to break the above limitations, please consider to use a Wechaty Puppet other than using Web API, like [wechaty-puppet-padchat](https://github.com/lijiarui/wechaty-puppet-padchat).

Learn more about the Puppet at [Wechaty wiki: Puppet](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/wiki/Puppet)

## How to set puppeteer launchOptions?

An example of adding executablePath to puppeteer.launch():

```js
const bot = new Wechaty({
  name: 'mybot',
  puppet: 'wechaty-puppet-wechat',
  // ...
  puppetOptions: {
    endpoint: '<executablePath>'
  }
});

// or
const bot = new Wechaty({
  name: 'mybot',
  puppet: 'wechaty-puppet-wechat',
  // ...
  puppetOptions: {
    launchOptions: {
      executablePath: '<executablePath>',
      // ... others launchOptions, see: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.18.1/docs/api.md#puppeteerlaunchoptions
    }
  }
});
```

We use [stealth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth) to make puppeteer more like a normal browser, if you want to disabled it, just set the `WECHATY_PUPPET_WECHAT_PUPPETEER_STEALTHLESS` environment variable to `1`. eg. `WECHATY_PUPPET_WECHAT_PUPPETEER_STEALTHLESS=1 ts-node your-bot.ts`

[In rare cases](https://github.com/wechaty/matrix-appservice-wechaty/issues/78#issuecomment-882208894), we could meet some problem and see `Error: Could not find expected browser` when we start PuppetWeChatBridge and try to run `initBrowser()`. A easy way to solve this problem is set `WECHATY_PUPPET_WECHAT_ENDPOINT` environment variable to `<your executablePath>`. eg. `WECHATY_PUPPET_WECHAT_ENDPOINT=/usr/bin/chromium-browser ts-node your-bot.ts`
